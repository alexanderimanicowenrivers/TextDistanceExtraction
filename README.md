# TextDistanceExtraction
A python tool for extracting distance measurements from text and normalising their values to cm. 

1) To install packages, either install pipenv by `pip pipenv` or install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (requirements.txt created from pip freeze so they should be the same)

2) Run setup script to download spacey textual model `sh setup.sh`, and also checks types. 

3) Run `jupyter notebook` and look in [distance extraction demo.ipynb](https://github.com/alexanderimanicowenrivers/TextDistanceExtraction/blob/master/distance%20extraction%20demo.ipynb) to see an example of using the distance extraction toolkit.
